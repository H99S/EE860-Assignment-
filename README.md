In this project, the goal was to predict the age of abalones based on various physical attributes. The data set was preprocessed by adding the target variable ‘age’, which was derived from the ‘ Rings’ feature. After conducting exploratory data analysis, including visualizations of the data distribution and correlations, the dataset was split into training and testing sets. 5 regression models- Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost- were implemented and evaluated for their predictive performance. The final model, Random Forest Regression, achieved promising results with a root mean squared error. The model was then saved for future use. Additionally, a function ‘predicted age’ was created to predict the age of abalones based on user input.
